# Flutter Development in a Box: A Dockerized Fedora Environment

Welcome, students! This project provides a complete, ready-to-use development environment for building Flutter applications. Think of it like a perfectly configured computer, packed neatly into a single box (a Docker container), that you can run on any machine.

Instead of spending hours installing and configuring the Flutter SDK, Android SDK, and all their dependencies on your own computer, this project lets you get straight to coding in a clean, predictable, and powerful Fedora Linux environment.

## The Problem We're Solving

As a computer science student, you've probably encountered these frustrating issues:

*   **"It works on my machine!"**: Your project works perfectly, but your teammate or professor can't get it to run because of differences in their setup.
*   **Complex Installation**: Setting up a new development environment can be a difficult process involving many steps, environment variables, and potential conflicts with software you already have.
*   **Keeping Your Computer Clean**: Installing many different SDKs and tools directly on your computer can clutter your system. What if you just want to try Flutter without committing to a full installation?

This Docker-based environment solves all these problems by providing a consistent and isolated workspace for everyone.

## 🤔 Is This Setup Really Worth It?

This is a fair question. You still have to install Docker, VS Code, and even Android Studio just to use the emulator. So what do you actually gain?

The answer: **You are trading a few simple, stable installations for the complete elimination of complex, fragile, and error-prone environment management.** The container saves you from the most common sources of frustration in development.

| Task                                 | Traditional Local Setup                                    | Docker Container Setup                                        |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Install Flutter SDK**              | ✅ **Manual** (Download, unzip, hope it's the right version) | ❌ **Not needed** (It's in the image)                         |
| **Manage PATH variable**             | ✅ **Manual** (Error-prone, can conflict with other tools)   | ❌ **Not needed** (The container's PATH is pre-configured)    |
| **Install & manage Java (JDK)**      | ✅ **Manual** (Can have version conflicts)                   | ❌ **Not needed** (The correct version is in the image)       |
| **Install Android command-line tools** | ✅ **Manual** (Via Android Studio's SDK Manager)             | ❌ **Not needed** (They are in the image)                     |
| **Ensure team uses same versions**   | 😥 **Difficult** (Requires manual checks and discipline)     | 😎 **Guaranteed** (Everyone uses the same image)               |
| **Set up a new computer**            | ⏳ **Slow** (Hours of re-installation and configuration)     | ⚡️ **Fast** (Just clone the repo and reopen in container)   |
| **Keep host OS clean**               | ❌ No (SDKs and tools are installed globally)                | ✅ Yes (Everything is isolated within the container)          |
| **Install Android Emulator**         | ✅ **Manual** (Via Android Studio)                           | ✅ **Manual** (Via Android Studio)                            |

**The Bottom Line:** This setup guarantees that your project works the same for you, for your teammates, and for your professor. It makes setting up a new computer trivial and prepares you for the way modern software is developed professionally. It's a massive win for consistency and your own sanity.

## 📋 Prerequisites

You only need a **few** things installed on your own computer (your "host" machine):

1.  **Docker Desktop**: The engine that runs our containerized environment. Download it for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux) from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A powerful, free code editor. Download it from the [official VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3.  **Android Studio**: We **only** need this to install and run the Android Emulator. You will not be using it to write code.
    *   Download it from the [Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    *   After installing, follow the on-screen prompts to let it download the default Android SDK components.

> **IMPORTANT**: You do **NOT** need to install Flutter or Dart on your own machine. That's the whole point of this project! The container has it all.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Your Development Environment

Follow these steps to go from zero to a fully running Flutter development environment.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder

1.  Create a new folder on your computer for your Flutter project. Let's call it `my_flutter_project`.
2.  Open this empty folder in **VS Code**.

### Step 2: Create the Configuration Files

You will create two essential configuration files inside your project folder.

**1. The Docker Compose File (`docker-compose.yml`)**

This file tells Docker *how* to run our container, including networking and file sharing. Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` and paste this in:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  flutter-dev:
    image: fcarella/flutter-fedora:latest
    stdin_open: true # Keeps the container running for an interactive session
    tty: true        # Connects your terminal to the container's terminal
    working_dir: /home/flutteruser/app

    # Mounts your current folder into the container's workspace
    volumes:
      - .:/home/flutteruser/app

    # --- Networking: CONFIGURE FOR YOUR OS! ---
    # Option 1: For Linux hosts. (Default)
    network_mode: host
    # Option 2: For Windows/macOS hosts. (Comment out the line above and uncomment these)
    # environment:
    #   - ADB_SERVER_SOCKET=tcp:host.docker.internal:5037```

**2. The Dev Container File (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)**

This file tells VS Code how to connect to and use the Docker container.

1.  First, create a new folder named `.devcontainer` in your project root.
2.  Inside the `.devcontainer` folder, create a new file named `devcontainer.json` and paste this in:

```json
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "Flutter Dev Container",
  "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
  "service": "flutter-dev",
  "workspaceFolder": "/home/flutteruser/app",
  "remoteUser": "flutteruser",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "Dart-Code.flutter",
        "Dart-Code.dart-code"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: 🔧 Final Configuration

1.  **Install the "Dev Containers" Extension:** In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for `Dev Containers`. Install the one published by Microsoft.

2.  **Configure Networking for Your OS:**
    *   Open `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **If you are on Linux:** You are all set! The file is ready.
    *   **If you are on Windows or macOS:**
        1.  Add a `#` to the beginning of the `network_mode: host` line to disable it.
        2.  Remove the `#` from the two `environment:` lines.

### Step 4: ▶️ Launch Everything

1.  **Start the Android Emulator:** Open Android Studio, go to **Tools > Device Manager**, and press the Play (▶️) button next to your virtual device.

2.  **Launch the Dev Container in VS Code:**
    *   Open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**).
    *   Type in and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**.
    *   VS Code will now reload. The first time, this will take a few minutes as it downloads the Docker image and sets up the container.

You are now ready to code! The bottom-left corner of VS Code will say **"Dev Container: Flutter Dev Container"**, indicating you are connected.

## 💻 Your Workflow

Now that you're connected, you have a powerful and seamless IDE experience.

### Create and Run Your First App

1.  **Open a Terminal in VS Code:** Go to **Terminal > New Terminal** (or press **Ctrl+`**). This is a terminal running *inside* your container.

2.  **Create a "Hello World" app:**
    ```bash
    flutter create hello_world
    ```

3.  **Run with Full Debugging:**
    *   Open the `hello_world/lib/main.dart` file.
    *   Go to the **Run and Debug** panel on the left (or press **F5**).
    *   Click the green **Play** button at the top.
    *   VS Code will compile the app and launch it on your emulator.

You now have a full debugging experience with breakpoints, variable inspection, and Flutter's most famous feature: Hot Reload.

---

## 🔥 Hot Reload: Flutter's Superpower

Yes, this setup **fully supports both Hot Reload and Hot Restart**, giving you the instant feedback loop that makes Flutter development so fast and fun.

*   **Hot Reload (the default):** Injects new code changes into the running app's virtual machine. The app's state is preserved. This is perfect for instantly seeing UI changes.
*   **Hot Restart:** Destroys the current app state and restarts the application from the beginning. Use this when you've made changes that affect the app's state.

### How does it work in our Docker setup?

It works because of two key connections between your computer (the host) and the Docker container:

1.  **Live File Syncing:** In `docker-compose.yml`, the `volumes` line creates a shared folder. When you press **Ctrl+S** to save a file in VS Code, that file is instantly updated inside the container.

2.  **Live Device Connection:** The `network_mode` or `environment` setting creates a network bridge. The `flutter run` command *inside the container* sees your file change and uses this bridge to send the updated code to the Android emulator running on your host machine.

### How to Use It

*   **Automatic:** Just save a file (**Ctrl+S**) while your app is running in debug mode.
*   **Manual:** In the VS Code terminal where `flutter run` is active, you can press:
    *   **`r`** to trigger a Hot Reload.
    *   **`R`** (Shift + r) to trigger a Hot Restart.

## 📦 Building a Release APK

When you're ready to share your app, you can build a final, optimized APK file.

1.  Open the VS Code terminal (Ctrl+`).
2.  Navigate to your app's directory (`cd hello_world`).
3.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    flutter build apk --release
    ```
4.  The final APK will be located on your host machine at: `hello_world/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

Happy coding
